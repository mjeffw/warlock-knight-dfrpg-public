A Foundry VTT Add-On Module by Gaming Ballistic

This is the public repository for support of the Warlock Knight Foundry VTT module.

## Warlock Knght

**for Dungeon Fantasy RPG (Powered by GURPS).**

Warlock Knight is a conversion to the Dungeon Fantasy RPG of David Pulver's existing solo adventure by the same name, which first appeared for The Fantasy Trip by Gaming Ballistic.

This Foundry VTT Module for Warlock Knight provides the pre-generated PCs, NPCs, monsters, and adversaries as Foundry Actors. It also includes maps and scenes from the book. It requires the GURPS Game Aid for Foundry VTT.

## Using this Module

After installation into your Foundry instance, you access the module by selecting the "Compendiums" tab in the sidebar on the right of the Foundry window. There should be "Warlock Knght Actors" and "Warlock Knght Scenes" compendium packs available.

Clicking on a compendium pack will open a window inside Foundry with an alphabetically sorted list of all the compendium entries.
